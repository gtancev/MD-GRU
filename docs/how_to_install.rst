How to install 
''''''''''''''

Requirements (on ubuntu) can be installed
using the following lines of code. Dependencies will be handled by the setup.py file (installation via GitHub using pip). In addition, **mvloader** has to be installed.

It's best to use a virtual environment (e.g. conda) with Python==3.5.2. In additon, make sure you have CUDA/cuDNN installed.
